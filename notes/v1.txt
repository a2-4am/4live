4live
a 4am & san inc hack

v1 design notes:

global hotkey (Ctrl-@) to enter 4live

40x23 editing space for notes (full 40-column text screen, minus a 1-row status bar)

immediately in editing/notetaking mode -- no separate command mode (think Emacs, not vi)

initial cursor position is top-left corner, but
*** remember cursor position across reboot *** (must persist on disk along with contents)

editor is always in overstrike mode (there is no insert mode)
- so no way to insert lines (!)

editor keyboard commands
- left/right/up/down arrows - free movement around 40x23 editing space
- <Return> - move cursor to first column of next row, with wrap around to first row
- <Esc> - close editor, return to reality
- <Ctrl-@) - same as <Esc>
- <Ctrl-S> - save notes to disk

non-goals (for v1)
- inverse text
- flashing text
- auto-right-justified text
- auto-center-justified text
- convenience functions ("draw a line of hyphens")
- insert row
- scrolling (more than 23 lines)
- paging (multiple "screens")
